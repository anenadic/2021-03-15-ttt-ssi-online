13:27:30 From Matthew Gillman to Everyone : Ok thanks
13:37:29 From Tim Booth to Everyone : Is it significant that this mental model is a DAG? :-P
13:39:17 From Matthew Bluteau (he/him) to Everyone : Need to avoid circular logic ;)
13:39:55 From Alan O'Callaghan to Everyone : Not all of them are acyclic :)
13:41:14 From Jamie Quinn (he/him) to Everyone : https://asciiflow.com/#/ is a nice tool for text-based freeform graphs
14:03:14 From Jon Hill to Everyone : Break would be good
14:04:11 From Tim Booth to Everyone : @Jamie I've bookmarked asciiflow - cool tool, thanks.
14:04:28 From Malika Ihle (she/her) to Aleks Nenadic [instructor](Direct Message) : sorry I arrived 30 min late - I got the time wrong in my calendar...
14:04:45 From Malika Ihle (she/her) to Aleks Nenadic [instructor](Direct Message) : I did catch up on the etherpad
14:10:13 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Malika Ihle (she/her)(Direct Message) : No worries - if you need any help - let me know. The first 30 minutes was an intro anyway!
14:13:29 From Andr√©s Romanowski to Aleks Nenadic [instructor](Direct Message) : I think the timer halted
14:14:53 From Andr√©s Romanowski to Aleks Nenadic [instructor](Direct Message) : I am here
14:15:02 From Andr√©s Romanowski to Aleks Nenadic [instructor](Direct Message) : strange... I cannot see it
14:15:09 From Andr√©s Romanowski to Aleks Nenadic [instructor](Direct Message) : it looks stuck at 13:28
14:15:27 From Andr√©s Romanowski to Aleks Nenadic [instructor](Direct Message) : I can see you and Stephen moving
14:15:36 From Andr√©s Romanowski to Aleks Nenadic [instructor](Direct Message) : but the shared screen looks stuck
14:17:01 From Jamie Quinn (he/him) to Everyone : @Tim you're very welcome!
14:18:29 From Matthew Bluteau (he/him) to Everyone : draw.io is also pretty good for flow charts
14:22:14 From Matthew Bluteau (he/him) to Everyone : a
14:22:17 From Ben Thorpe to Everyone : a)
14:22:21 From Andr√©s Romanowski to Everyone : 42
14:22:22 From James Thomas (he/him) to Everyone : a :)
14:22:24 From Christopher Lovell to Everyone : meaning of life!
14:22:54 From Andr√©s Romanowski to Everyone : +1
14:26:01 From Matthew Bluteau (he/him) to Everyone : lol almost missed the Hitchhiker's reference :D
14:32:25 From Jamie Quinn (he/him) to Everyone : Going to have to leave until 15:00. See you all in a bit!
14:33:16 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : ha! 42 - nice one - the answer to everything
14:58:02 From Riva Quiroga to Everyone : +1
15:00:20 From Jamie Quinn to Everyone : +1 the difference in languages is such a big one
15:03:06 From James Thomas (he/him) to Everyone : +1 tab completion is great for you, but confuses people watching
15:03:20 From Malika Ihle (she/her) to Everyone : +1 I'm so overwhelmed with people using shortcuts as I have no idea what happened...
15:03:47 From Jamie Quinn to Everyone : So you're saying I SHOULDNT use vim in the carpentries?
15:04:01 From Matthew Bluteau (he/him) to Everyone : vim keybinding FTW
15:04:02 From James Thomas (he/him) to Everyone : Jamie ü§£
15:04:38 From Shashank Harivyasi (he/him) to Everyone : Use vim; learner spends rest of the time figuring out how to quit
15:04:41 From Tim Booth to Everyone : Participants wondering why I keep randomly typing :wq into Nano...
15:05:05 From James Thomas (he/him) to Everyone : "obviously ‚Ä¶"
15:05:17 From Jamie Quinn to Everyone : +1 "trivially" in maths
15:05:39 From Abhishek Dasgupta to Everyone : "left as an exercise for the reader"
15:05:48 From James Thomas (he/him) to Everyone : :)
15:06:01 From James Thomas (he/him) to Everyone : Those exercises take me longer than the course itself :)
15:06:12 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : ‚ÄúSimply"
15:06:21 From Stephen Crouch [instructor] to Everyone : ‚ÄúAll  you need to do is..."
15:06:39 From Riva Quiroga to Everyone : "Everyone knows this..."
15:06:45 From Abhishek Dasgupta to Everyone : This is not complicated at all -- proceed to list 11 steps
15:07:21 From Tim Booth to Everyone : But sometimes a learner will be attempting a complex fix for something that can be done simply.
15:07:53 From Thibault Lestang to Everyone : Agreed, sometimes in computing things are less complicated that most novices expect
15:08:04 From Jamie Quinn to Everyone : @Tim +1 agreed, sometimes it's useful to signal that something *is* actually simple
15:08:48 From Jamie Quinn to Everyone : But perhaps backed up by "this isn't as hard as it looks"
15:14:09 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : Back 15:30
15:33:35 From Jamie Quinn to Everyone : memory IS RAM
15:40:37 From James Thomas (he/him) to Everyone : I like that people are repeating the test and taking an average :)
15:40:45 From Bryan Wee to Everyone : no one with photographic memory in this class? :)
15:41:20 From James Thomas (he/him) to Everyone : 21 :)
15:44:55 From Matthew Gillman to Everyone : Me too!
15:49:21 From Abhishek Dasgupta to Everyone : Will have to try after some chocolate to see effect of sugar! Tried chunking first time already :)
15:50:18 From Matthew Gillman to Everyone : a concept map is a mind map?
15:51:16 From Malika Ihle (she/her) to Everyone : google says: The differences between mind maps and conceptual maps are: Mind map has a radial structure, while the concept map has a tree structure with many branches and clusters. Mind map focus on one concept, while concept map connects multiple concepts or ideas.
15:54:59 From Malika Ihle (she/her) to Everyone : on the git one - what does the size of the arrows mean?
15:55:40 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : I wonder if it‚Äôs reversion?
15:55:44 From Tim Booth to Everyone : The GIT one is confusing me. And I thought I knew about GIT!
15:55:49 From Malika Ihle (she/her) to Everyone : same
15:56:16 From Matthew Gillman to Everyone : I agree Tim!
15:56:19 From Alan O'Callaghan to Everyone : commit doesn't necessarily relate to a branch but I suspect I'm being overly pedantic
15:59:34 From Jamie Quinn to Everyone : dammit, the for loop is *literally* the episode I chose
16:00:13 From Matthew Bluteau (he/him) to Everyone : I also chose the for loop episode :(
16:00:28 From Abhishek Dasgupta to Everyone : with large concept maps, it's a bit difficult to understand how to start parsing it, maybe have highlighted nodes
16:16:13 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : I feel like I needed a concept map before I could create a concept map
16:16:15 From Alan O'Callaghan to Everyone : not really a fan honestly
16:16:33 From Thibault Lestang to Everyone : Was surprinsingly difficult!
16:16:52 From Abhishek Dasgupta to Everyone : I think they are fine for a certain size with < 12 items. Any larger and it becomes difficult to parse
16:17:06 From Shashank Harivyasi (he/him) to Everyone : +1 @Abhishek
16:29:27 From Matthew Bluteau (he/him) to Everyone : Will the slides be made available?
16:35:28 From Andrew Romanowski to Aleks Nenadic [instructor](Direct Message) : Thank you!
16:35:37 From Jon Hill to Everyone : see you tmrw
