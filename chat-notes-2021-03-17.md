13:00:49 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : Notes: https://pad.carpentries.org/2021-03-16-ttt-ssi-online
13:03:41 From Matthew Gillman to Everyone : do we have to record our attendance on the etherpad again? If so, which line is it at?
13:05:49 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : Line 525 please - it got deleted by mistake it seems - apologies
13:06:39 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : https://pad.carpentries.org/2021-03-16-ttt-ssi-online
13:06:40 From abhidg to Everyone : Can't rename myself
13:06:41 From Stephen Crouch [instructor] to Everyone : https://pad.carpentries.org/2021-03-16-ttt-ssi-online
13:07:19 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : @abhidg In the participants list, click the ‘More’ button - it should have a drop down menu and Rename option there
13:08:22 From Timothy Booth to Everyone : I don't think that's working today. Permissions have reset, maybe?
13:08:42 From abhidg to Everyone : There's no more button for me, I tried rename by right clicking on my zoom, but the rename does not go through
13:09:12 From Alan O'Callaghan to Everyone : No, it means I didn't have one
13:09:13 From Morgan Essex to Everyone : No meaning no negative experience
13:09:17 From Christopher Lovell to Everyone : No for 'didn't have a negative experience'
13:09:25 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : I said “Yes, I had a negative experience”
13:09:31 From Timothy Booth to Everyone : Same for me
13:09:43 From Matthew Bluteau to Everyone : Yes, same for me "no meaning no negative experience"
13:10:25 From Matthew Bluteau to Everyone : Although trying to use Emacs once was pretty demoralising ;)
13:13:43 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to abhidg(Direct Message) : I can try to rename you if you like - le me know what name you wish to use
13:13:54 From abhidg to Aleks Nenadic [instructor](Direct Message) : Thanks! Abhishek Dasgupta
13:13:55 From Christopher Lovell to Everyone : Using vim for the first time was demoralising, until I went online and realised that almost *everyone* didn't know how to exit it the first time they used it... !
13:14:10 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Abhishek Dasgupta(Direct Message) : Done
13:15:30 From Timothy Booth to Everyone : Ha, you got to use Vim? I started off on basic Vi :-P
13:15:35 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : I still can’t exit vim - just binned the laptop xD
13:16:55 From Abhishek Dasgupta to Everyone : Interesting bit for emacs -> vim switchers, if you press Ctrl X Ctrl C in vim, it shows you how to quit :)
13:19:02 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : Is there a “critical line” on the graph above/below which we shouldn’t teach? You showed the areas, was wondering how they join up in the space
13:19:18 From Stephen Crouch [instructor] to Everyone : Back at 13:30
13:30:51 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : https://pad.carpentries.org/2021-03-16-ttt-ssi-online
13:39:06 From tzielins to Everyone : for all three startegis types or just the Establish Value ones
13:40:07 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : One’s belief in one’s ability to succeed - google ;)
13:40:55 From Stephen Crouch [instructor] to Everyone : That’s the most concise answer!
13:41:00 From Christopher Lovell to Everyone : we're not doing this in groups?
13:41:17 From Timothy Booth to Everyone : apparently not
13:46:55 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : Omg, it’s been so long since I participated in a course instead of running one xD
13:47:42 From Morgan Essex to Everyone : :D
13:47:57 From Alan O'Callaghan to Everyone : Etherpad has decided it wants to periodically reload, is that just for me?
13:48:27 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : No, it does for me as well and sends me back up to the top
13:48:47 From Alan O'Callaghan to Everyone : Good to know. Very annoying paging down 700 lines
13:49:35 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : Etherpad sometimes disconnects :-(
13:51:51 From James Thomas to Everyone : :)
14:01:43 From Matthew Gillman to Everyone : or a rubber duck
14:02:09 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : Rubber duckie debugging - love it - works every time
14:02:39 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : My husband often acts as a very good rubber duck
14:03:41 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : The Carpentries have actually set rubber ducks to people in the past (or given away at conferences) - mine is on my desk
14:04:02 From Matthew Gillman to Everyone : Show us, Aleks!
14:04:29 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : I would love a Carpentries rubber duck <3
14:04:32 From Andrés Romanowski to Everyone : Hi! English is not my first language so that might be why I don't see this point:

What do you mean by using the word 'just'?
14:04:44 From Matthew Gillman to Everyone : You just have to do this
14:04:52 From Matthew Gillman to Everyone : Makes it sound trivially easy
14:04:55 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : “Just” implies it’s trivial and they should have already thought of it
14:05:08 From Andrés Romanowski to Everyone : Ok, I see! Thanks!
14:05:19 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : @Andres “you just do this” or  “simply” implying that the things is easy or trivial whereas your learners might find it very hard
14:05:54 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : This can make them feel inferior or stupid - if everyone else is finding this easy and I am not -> I must be stupd
14:06:16 From Andrés Romanowski to Everyone : Excellent, thanks for clarifying that!
14:07:01 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : I use my whole PhD as a reproducibility mistake when teaching the concept xD
14:07:14 From Andrés Romanowski to Everyone : hahaha cool!
14:07:30 From Andrés Romanowski to Everyone : should do the same!
14:07:36 From Thibault Lestang to Everyone : Haha same here
14:07:46 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : :-) I think many of us relate to that @Sarah
14:08:46 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : Mine is also an example of “working in isolation”
14:09:02 From Matthew Gillman to Everyone : I am hearing impaired. It can be very difficult to hear people who are wearing a covid mask!
14:10:20 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : Back at 14:25
14:28:07 From Timothy Booth to Everyone : Yep, I'll never win the Tour de France, and no amount of motivation will help!
14:29:15 From Jamie Q to Everyone : Given infinite time, sure
14:32:12 From Jamie Q to Everyone : I have a fixed mindset when it comes to changing my mindset
14:47:49 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : On this academic/creativity theme - it requires creative problem solving to work in research, we’ve just found the outlet that suits our particular brand of creativity :)
14:48:37 From Harry Moss to Everyone : +1 Sarah!
14:48:55 From Shashank S Harivyasi to Everyone : @Sarah: thanks for that insight; never thought of it that way. 
14:49:58 From Matthew Gillman to Everyone : Praise: important for parents to praise their kids
14:50:00 From tzielins to Everyone : isnt it that if you cannot give performance praise you get away but give improvement one?
14:50:29 From tzielins to Everyone : so every time I am getting improvement praise I will wander was I not good enough?
14:53:05 From Malika Ihle to Everyone : yes I have mixed feeling about improvement based praise if I wasn't provided with feedback on my first work: what was wrong the first time?:?
14:53:11 From Alan O'Callaghan to Everyone : I think there's a distinction between praise that implies good performance due to innate skill and praise of good performance without that implication...?
14:54:40 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : +1 @Alan
14:55:04 From Malika Ihle to Everyone : @Tim Booth: what if someone is still struggling - won't he think then that he isn't a natural?
14:56:20 From Alan O'Callaghan to Everyone : Any of this praise can feel alienating for someone who has put in similar effort without seeing similar improvement, surely
14:57:25 From abhidg to Everyone : +1 @Alan
14:57:47 From Malika Ihle to Everyone : +1 @Alan
14:58:55 From Malika Ihle to Everyone : there are certainly differences in cultures as well on how to praise
14:59:02 From Alan O'Callaghan to Everyone : ^
15:01:37 From Matthew Bluteau to Everyone : LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python), the only lamp I recognise
15:06:56 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : Back at 15:21
15:07:17 From Timothy Booth to Everyone : Thanks
15:27:19 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : Should also be noted that this is about “lesson study” so how instructors improve teaching practices, rather what what they expect from the students.
15:27:52 From Matthew Gillman to Everyone : Can you separate the two?
15:28:11 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : This is about improving how we teach
15:28:21 From Matthew Gillman to Everyone : Good point
15:28:26 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : And hoe we learn from fellowship instructors
15:28:30 From Christopher Lovell to Everyone : @Aleks +1
15:28:58 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : *how we learn from fellow instructors* - previous message came out all wrong ;-)
15:38:10 From Matthew Gillman to Aleks Nenadic [instructor](Direct Message) : I hope I haven’t upset you Aleks!
15:38:41 From Alan O'Callaghan to Everyone : You'd hope that you could only teach that badly if you know how to teach well but I've been to courses like that
15:38:53 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Matthew Gillman(Direct Message) : Oh, no - of course not. It is absolutely critical that we clarify things that we do no explain well and something that we should improve in our materials too!
15:39:28 From Matthew Gillman to Aleks Nenadic [instructor](Direct Message) : Thanks!!
15:39:49 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Matthew Gillman(Direct Message) : It is really good to have these discussions as a group too and hear all opinions
15:40:34 From Matthew Gillman to Aleks Nenadic [instructor](Direct Message) : Yes indeed
16:15:22 From Jamie Q to Everyone : 90s seemed ideal!
16:30:46 From James Thomas to Everyone : Does we start from the beginning (like today) or at a mid-point?
16:30:50 From James Thomas to Everyone : *Do we
16:31:12 From James Thomas to Everyone : Thanks
16:32:32 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : You did great Stephen! :)
16:32:34 From Timothy Booth to Everyone : Thanks. See you tomorrow.
16:32:42 From Shashank S Harivyasi to Everyone : Thanks!
16:32:43 From Matthew Gillman to Everyone : I thought your delivery was fine Stephen
16:32:43 From Riva Quiroga to Everyone : thanks!!!
16:32:43 From Christopher Lovell to Everyone : Thanks Stephen and Aleks!
16:32:46 From Bryan Wee to Everyone : Thanks, Stephen!
16:32:51 From abhidg to Everyone : Thanks Stephen and Aleks!
16:32:57 From Matthew Gillman to Everyone : Thank you both !
16:33:06 From Thibault Lestang to Everyone : Thanks Stephen and Aleks!
16:33:51 From James Thomas to Everyone : Thanks Stephen and Aleks!!!
