13:02:30 From Bryan to Everyone : no, I can't either

13:04:32 From James Thomas to Aleks Nenadic [instructor](Direct Message) : Apparently:

In your active meeting, in the toolbar below the screen, click Participants.

At the bottom of the participants window, click More.

Hover your cursor over Allow participants to rename themselves. When you see the blue highlight, click the text. A checkmark will appear next to the text indicating that the feature is turned on. Your meeting participants can now rename themselves.
13:05:27 From James Thomas to Everyone : No worries - I had to Google it as I couldn't find it either!
13:05:44 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : https://pad.carpentries.org/2021-03-16-ttt-ssi-online
13:07:02 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : I really enjoyed the theory :)
13:07:29 From Christopher Lovell to Everyone : ^ same!
13:15:46 From Aleks Nenadic [instructor] to Everyone : Ah, that’s great - we do have a bit of theory for you in store today :-)
13:34:23 From Jamie Q to Everyone : Depends on the confidence of the instructor
13:34:24 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : Handling potentially derailing questions is a skill in itself
13:34:36 From Jamie Q to Everyone : ^^ @sarah
13:35:30 From Abhishek Dasgupta to Everyone : It can be hard to reproduce or follow later if the lecture is not recorded, or materials accompanying are not kept updated.
13:36:11 From Alan O'Callaghan to Everyone : If it's going faster than people can keep up with, it may be disheartening
13:36:25 From Andrés to Everyone : @alan +1
13:36:27 From Alan O'Callaghan to Everyone : Though this is true for any presentation style
13:36:57 From Jamie Q to Everyone : I imagine it's hell for dyslexic teachers & learners
13:37:39 From Jamie Q to Everyone : @Christopher I think I'd disagree, learners have access to the materials & can speed ahead if they wish
13:38:23 From Bryan Wee to Everyone : good point Tim
13:38:33 From Andrés to Everyone : +1 @tim
13:38:39 From Christopher Lovell to Everyone : @Jamie sure, but then they're not doing live coding ;)
13:38:47 From Matthew Bluteau to Everyone : I was going to make a similar comment @Tim
13:39:00 From Jamie Q to Everyone : @Christopher True!
13:39:48 From Jamie Q to Everyone : @Tim is that perhaps why carpentry lessons stay in alpha/beta for SO long?
13:41:41 From Jamie Q to Everyone : Should a dyslexic-friendly font be the DEFAULT for live coding...? Surely it's easier to read for everyone else too?
13:43:16 From Tim Booth to Everyone : Is there any specific recommendation for dyslexic-friendly console font? I'd love to give that a try. Agree with Jamie - this could just be the default.
13:44:02 From Jon Hill to Everyone : OpenDyslexic font
13:44:09 From Shashank S Harivyasi to Everyone : https://opendyslexic.org/
13:44:13 From Abhishek Dasgupta to Everyone : http://dyslexiahelp.umich.edu/sites/default/files/good_fonts_for_dyslexia_study.pdf discusses a review of common fonts, and Courier is the monospace font in that list
13:44:42 From Matthew Bluteau to Everyone : Really good points. And thanks for the resources
13:44:55 From Matthew Bluteau to Everyone : Certainly makes sense to have this as default
13:45:42 From Jon Hill to Everyone : I find it quite difficult to read as someone who isn't dyslexic, but a standard courier font seems ok with students I've taught in the past
13:46:32 From Tim Booth to Everyone : For the terminal you need a font where 1 and l and 0 and O look distinct.
13:46:36 From Matthew Bluteau to Everyone : also not monospace from what I can tell
13:47:10 From Sarah Gibson (she/her) to Everyone : Today was not the day for me to give a live-coding workshop in the morning! xD
13:47:55 From Thibault Lestang to Everyone : Helpers probably are key to make sure everyone is on the same page. A workshop is given by a team after all, not a single instructor!
13:47:58 From Jamie Q to Everyone : Apparently monospaced fonts are already easier to read (https://designwoop.com/font-for-dyslexia) so perhaps it's not as important for terminals...
