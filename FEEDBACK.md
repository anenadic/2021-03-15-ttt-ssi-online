# Day 1 Feedback
## What is the most important thing you learned today. What new skill are you most excited about using?
- concept of mental map and working memory, motivational language
- language used
- Importance of formative assessment. +1
- How pervasive Carpentries-style training is, hadn't realised how much I'd already picked up from colleagues who have already been through the course - proof that it works!
- language (motivational/demotivational), formative assessments +1
- motivational/demotivational language+1+1
-  the idea of trying to get into somebody's mental model
- exploring chunking (as horrible as the word sounds)
- Novice vs competent vs Expert concept maps
- formative assessment
- Concept maps, can see them being useful for some thngs although given the time they take to make they are definatly not good for some things.
- Summative vs Formative assessment definitions
- some of the language terms, and asking "what questions do people have?"
- formative assessments and how to think about learners' mental models when teaching
- the importance of good "wrong" multitest answers+1
- the idea that experts have more connections in their mental map of a subject; nice way of framing it
- identifying misconception on the basis of an answered MCQ+1
  
## Write down one thing that is confusing and you‚Äôd like clarification on. What could be improved upon in the material and delivery?
- Could go a bit faster +1 It was about the right pace for me though :)
- More examples of mental models would be great, I find it an overly abstract concept
- what's a good/bad concept map+1+1+1+1(let's make a concept map?;)
- Everything was really clear :)
- why so much focus on short memorry capacity when I do not want learners to remember, there is google for that  I want them to understand
- maybe make the breakout rooms larger.
- 1-1 breakout room is a bit small, larger group would be easier perhaps
- Maybe 3 people in the maps sessions? (see ‚Üì)
- 1-to-1 maps sessions were a bit awkward, need more details
- It was difficult to quickly think of a topic for the concept map, and I got a bit anxious as time ticked by, until I thought of something+1+1
- We could spend more time reviewing the answers to the exercises+1+1
- we covered one example of formative assessment (MCQ), one of instructional planning tool (concept map) and one of guided practice (faded examples). It would be nice to know more variety of such tools to fit different teaching styles/topics.
- I agree concept map sessions could have had more people in them in instructions for what we actually needed to do could have been more clear; also, I felt a bit time pressured coming up with the multiple choice question, so would have appreciated more time on this, or there could have been a "default" question suggestion and we could come up with wrong answers with justification (this way time wouldn't be wasted coming up with the question itself)

- The Feedback Sandwich+1
- The link between motivation, mindset and encouragement +1+1+1

- motivation techniques+1+1
- Growth vs fixed mindset and applying that more generally to my life :)+1+1+1+100
- To always  give feedback on two dimenssions, content and presentation
- Avoiding feedback that implies intrinsic traits+1+1

## Write down one thing that is confusing and you‚Äôd like clarification on. What could be improved upon in the material and delivery?
- (Change to group sizes worked well today - thanks!)
- I don't understand the emphasis on mindset. The carpentry workshops are for self-selceted group that wants to learn, so they are motivated and I don't think it matters if they believe they have talent for it or not, they all want to learn if I may, as en example I am motivated and want to learn statistics because I think that bad stats = pointless science, but I still think I'm inherently bad at maths, so I will need to overcome that perhaps if the teachers presents equations.(+1) for carpentry example: I want my research to be reproducible so I'm motivating in learning how to code / wrangle datasets but I think I'd be bad a programming complex stuff, or working from the command line. So I think the strategy to present concrete simple but very useful example at the start of the workshop can help with this 'fixed mindset'.
- Different participants in the breakout rooms made it difficult to build rapport. (Although in contrast, I liked the fact we moved around :) +1)
- Is there a preferred category of praise or are they all valid depending on context?
- Not a negative per se, but it would be good to have more time to practice presenting and getting feedback, though I appreciate this is difficult to do in this online setting+1+1+1+1 especially as we were then giving feedback on each other (but not really a negative as I understand that was the point of the exercise!)
- The content was quite clear, but I had never thought about praise and mindset so much, so it will take some time to integrate it into how I present/teach. Very useful though
- Maybe have a different Etherpad per day? Makes it simpler to find the right location (or have shortcut links/table of contents - I think there is one in settings if that helps? Thanks! Didn't know about this)+1+1+1
- The bits on "praise" are a little abstract; however, I the surrounding conversation was excellent and instructive. I still contend that it okay to say "that is good work" to a student.
- Certain academics/events were mentioned, e.g. Guzdial and Ericson at Georgia Tech - it would be good to have the links/references/books for these. (Maybe they are in the lesson material?)+1
- I have heard in some situations the "praise/constructive criticism/praise" sandwich is more effective if you just do "praise/constructive criticism/action plan" as then the emphasis is on how to improve and not that you were without fault - would be interested to get your thoughts on this

PS - I like leaving feedback like this! (I like that we have/ can give feedback about feedback)

## What is the most important thing you learned today. What new skill are you most excited about using?
- Bloom's taxonomy - I'd never think to analyse objectives this way but it makes perfect sense+1+1+1+1
- Bloom's Taxonomy - though I can see myself sticking too it too rigorously and not allowing myself flex xD
- Live coding examples and videos were very useful!+1+1
- The hands on and feedback + watching/learning from others+1+1+1+100+1+1
- Not a skill per say, but, the oportunity for practice and receiving feedback from others+1+1
- I still have that bad habit of saying "just/well" a few times a minute and that is slightly irritating for people to hear +1 Same here! Good to watch a recording of yourself doing it (painful! - but useful)
 üëç <- this thumb (seriously though, practice & peer feedback!!) üëå
- Tips e.g. avoid being disturbed, embrace mistakes +1 defintely using them as a learning opportunity,...
- Order of: Learning objectives -> What evidence required -> Design exercises -> Design content+1
- Watching others teach so proficiently+1+1
- Practice and feedback opportunity+1+1
- live coding exercise in no-pressure environment is a great way to develop
- The feedback from the live coding exercises+1+1
- The shared videos were a good condensation for do's and don'ts of teaching+1
- Learner profiles seems like a good way to combat the "expert gap". Will definitely give these more thought before delivering a workshop
  
## Write down one thing that is confusing and you‚Äôd like clarification on. What could be improved upon in the material and delivery?
- I would prefer to define an objective after seeing a part of an episode or the excercise rather than looking at the "perfected" carpentry objective. I think defining the objectives is the most challenging part.+1
- The teaching practise wasn't super useful for me BUT I'd just done some live-coding training this morning and was probably wiped out
- The 3-minute teaching didn't give a chance to hit our stride or get to any participatory elements. But I'm not sure how it could be improved - we definitely want to practise teaching within the course+1+1+1+1 (even though that's the scary bit!) The second time, we started off from where we got to the first time, and we got further into the content which seemed to work well.
- Faded example of good objective? Going from a bad to a better one?
- More info (brief) on the Dunning-Kruger effect+1 Yes I've generally understood it to apply to people's assessment of "their intelligence" with the assumption that people have a measurable and fixed IQ (insert long and controversial dicussion here). But here we're talking about academics who are assessing their expertise in a particular domain, and the assumption is that everyone can obtain a good level of expertise given time and effort and good teaching.
- Writing the profiles was fun, but would like some info on how to get an understanding through the pre-workshop survey+1+1
 would like more live coding practice - I still don't feel ready to do it for real - (you are always more prepared than you think ;)
 - I would be nice to try and bring formative assessment or some way of getting feedback into the live coding example. This would connect the theory from the previous two days into the practice of this day. I'd also like to go through some suggested mechanisms for formative assessment in a little more detail - so I can use different variations during my courses and not all the same. And also would be good to know if there are likely to be any differences in exercises between classroom and online coding
- Interested in how to apply carpentries methods to more specialised content

## What is the most important thing you learned today. What new skill are you most excited about using?
- checkout procedure+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1
- modifying a carpentries template (although very superficially covered)+1+1+1+1+1+1
- That the checkout procedure is not as intensive as I originally thought it would be+1+1+1+1+1
- All the different ways I can connect and keep updated with the Carpentries+1
- Useful links 
 
## Write down one thing that is confusing and you‚Äôd like clarification on. What could be improved upon in the material and delivery?
- Not sure why we read & discussed the checkout procedures. Perhaps there could be a more directed question or discussion point.+1
- No point of dIscussion in groups the checkout procedure if the questions can only be answered by instructors - I personally found this useful to have the time to figure some of it out myself and with the group rather than just listening (possibly half listening) to the instructor and possibly miss something+1+1+1
- I appreciate that there was loads to cover today, but i am both excited and a bit overwhelmed with all the new things i've learned today! 
- Think the material on the checkout process and "how we operate" is great and has a lot of detail in it, however I still found it a little confusing and needed clarification from the instructors. I now understand better, but hopefully some of the feedback we gave regarding what counts as a workshop and whether we can just teach one lesson can be integrated and further improve the teaching material
- Today felt much more disjointed than previous days, perhaps just due to the different topics. Not sure how to solve or if it's even a bad thing but I found it a little difficult to maintain focus.+1
- Today felt a bit rushed. The lesson template could have been skipped, since it takes a while to explore all the different parts of the page. +1+1
 instructions to modify the workshop announcement github page template are outdated, I'm grateful someone in the group was able to redirect me (e.g. to find the deployment button etc)+1
 - We seem to have missed managing a diverse classroom?+1
- It would be helpful if material from today can be an assigned reading to be discussed. This way we would have a reference text with all the material and time to pick it apart.
