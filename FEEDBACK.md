# Day 1
## What went well? What did you learn and you are excited to use in your next workshop?
- enjoyed learning about concepts map, and will play with them more ***
- Concept maps as a means to developing material *
- excellent time-keeping, great to have a clear schedule*
- Faded examples +1+1+1+1+1*
- I really liked the notion of "cognitive load". I've seen this applied a lot in terms of human factors and how people work during times of crisis, but I had never considered how it could be used in education. Super interesting, thank you.+1+1
- I like the etherpad dynamic to gather feedback, can this be used in our courses?**
- Quite a few interesting and new (at least for me) concepts: concept maps + cognitive load + chunking, etc. *
- I enjoyed learning about general learning mechanisms and concepts, and faded examples was a great example
- good to get that understanding of how limited short term memory is!+1 +1 interesting exercise for it too!
- I think eventually I'll find concept maps useful, but I need to go and think about them some more! I think I now know how carpentry participants feel! A lot of the stuff we're taught feels pretty abstract and I'm not sure when it will be useful, but I'm sure it will be eventually (the worry is, that by time I do need it, I'll have forgotten some of the important parts!)
- mind maps/mental models - great way to understand what the learner understands
- Good to think about targeting experience level of learners
- I liked the part about making multiple-choice questions diagnostic, it seems much better than less-thoughtful approaches -agreed! And another +1
- Nice to understand relation between mental models and concept maps
(maybe I misunderstood - I didn't see what the difference between a mental model and a concept map was :/ )
- mental model is in your mind -- concept map is a visualisation of the mental model (usually incomplete) which you can share with others or keep for yourself.
hmm... I obviously need to go and google this again :)
- Good to know how to use MCQ more effectively
- Concept maps & Mental Models, understanding how people learn a topic
- Remembering to teach the novice, not assume understanding
- Good pace
- I liked the use of breakout rooms for exercises, easier to share ideas in a small group
- great effort for time-keeping
-  Idea of using concept maps to collaborate on development of new material
-  Pace was good, and with interesting content. I was interesting to learn how people learn!
-  time management & focus was very good
-  positive learning environment concept interesting, pace and timing very good
-  Good pace, Really liked the focus on evidence based teaching methods
-  Good content and super friendly people. Like the breakout rooms a lot
-  Peer-to-peer feedback as a driver of improvement of teaching skills
-  Very useful to have random breakout rooms. Much easier and nicer than in live/off-line workshops (no need to move around ;-)
- Lovely atmosphere and great content. Especially learning about "cognitive load" and "Mindset" was important for me.
- Well adpated to online, and really good to use the breakout groups+1+1+1
- breakout rooms work well and reduce performance pressure somewhat+1+1+1+1
- great to have lots of interactive exercises+1+1+1
- afternoon was better because of more exercises rather than just watching slides
- Having done some online teaching (including carpentries) during lockdown I know how draining it is, so I was impressed at how fresh you both still sounded at the end of the day!

## What can be improved? What was confusing? Needs more explanation?
- more clarity on what to do in break out rooms, e.g. if we have 15 minutes, is it 5 minutes to do work and 10 mins to discuss or the other way around?
- concept map part seemed disjointed, visiting it early on then returning to it without much explaination to the difference+1+1
- More clarity on breakout rooms, and perhaps larger rooms (only two of us in the last one).
- I think more of a balance between concept maps and the diagnostic multiple-choice questions would be good. Right now it is heavily skewed towards concept maps. I, personally, don't find concept maps very useful because they don't fit the way I think, and would have liked more discussion around designing questions to guage understanding. I can empathise with that, I think the examples I came up on the spot were very contrived and didn't really help me practice what they're really for (that may be exacerbating the issue, but I have disliked concept maps for as long as I have known of them)
- Take a litte more time to revisit people responses.*
- maybe a bit more time to look at faded examples would have been nice
- Felt quite one-way (even though we were invited to interrupt), but I think that's a facet of online teaching
- Pre-allocate bullet points in this etherpad+1
- Time to complete excercises could be checked with participants (no zoom clock).
- More time to discuss exercise responses, get feedback, etc.
- Zoom clock was invisible for me, need manual reminders of time for exercises (looks like Zoom on Linux does not support this?)
- more on me than the instructors, but I'm not creative enough to come up with MCQs on the spot
-  Create the ethernet content in advance  -1 -1
  - I think that might make it seem overwhelming from the outset - allowing it to grow organically through the course helps prevent that (in my experience)+1+1
 maybe a start could be Aleks and Steve teaching us a very short lesson in 'Carpentry' way, so we know from the start what we are heading towards.+1
- Introduce what the Carpentry is and how it is different from SSI.
-  differentiate between Software, Data & Library carpentries at the start
-  I would appreciate more depth on key concepts
-  good example to go with the bad example on content/presentation style+1
-  Zoom timer isn't visible on Linux!  Need some other way of indicating - I was always asking fellow group members+1+1
-  The 90 second exercises could have been more useful if a little longer (3 minutes perhaps)+1+1
-  Unsure exactly what type of feedback was useful / relevant on the 90 second presentation - I think I misread that exercise and a different lesson to the one I'd intended to! - (there's a slight mismatch between the pre-workshop instructions and the exercise instructions, I think)
- Not enough time to reflect on the responses from the participants (e.g. MCQs).
- i would have liked to have had an advance warning on the 90 second delivery without live coding (this was mentioned in the email) I had a prepared a 90 second talk on a - - - - research project and  3 minute live coding based on the carpentries as explained in the email both of the other people in my breakout room presented 90 seconds about their research
- I'm still confused by concept maps / mental models.... (or should that be concept models / mental maps?) 



# Day 1 Feedback
## What is the most important thing you learned today. What new skill are you most excited about using?
 concept of mental map and working memory, motivational language
 language used
 Importance of formative assessment. +1
How pervasive Carpentries-style training is, hadn't realised how much I'd already picked up from colleagues who have already been through the course - proof that it works!
 language (motivational/demotivational), formative assessments +1
  motivational/demotivational language+1+1
 the idea of trying to get into somebody's mental model
 exploring chunking (as horrible as the word sounds)
 Novice vs competent vs Expert concept maps
formative assessment
 Concept maps, can see them being useful for some thngs although given the time they take to make they are definatly not good for some things.
Summative vs Formative assessment definitions
some of the language terms, and asking "what questions do people have?"
formative assessments and how to think about learners' mental models when teaching
the importance of good "wrong" multitest answers+1
the idea that experts have more connections in their mental map of a subject; nice way of framing it
identifying misconception on the basis of an answered MCQ+1
  
## Write down one thing that is confusing and you’d like clarification on. What could be improved upon in the material and delivery?
 Could go a bit faster +1 It was about the right pace for me though :)
 More examples of mental models would be great, I find it an overly abstract concept
 what's a good/bad concept map+1+1+1+1(let's make a concept map?;)
 Everything was really clear :)
 why so much focus on short memorry capacity when I do not want learners to remember, there is google for that  I want them to understand
 maybe make the breakout rooms larger.
 1-1 breakout room is a bit small, larger group would be easier perhaps
 Maybe 3 people in the maps sessions? (see ↓)
 1-to-1 maps sessions were a bit awkward, need more details
It was difficult to quickly think of a topic for the concept map, and I got a bit anxious as time ticked by, until I thought of something+1+1
We could spend more time reviewing the answers to the exercises+1+1
we covered one example of formative assessment (MCQ), one of instructional planning tool (concept map) and one of guided practice (faded examples). It would be nice to know more variety of such tools to fit different teaching styles/topics.
I agree concept map sessions could have had more people in them in instructions for what we actually needed to do could have been more clear; also, I felt a bit time pressured coming up with the multiple choice question, so would have appreciated more time on this, or there could have been a "default" question suggestion and we could come up with wrong answers with justification (this way time wouldn't be wasted coming up with the question itself)

## Write down one thing that is confusing and you’d like clarification on. What could be improved upon in the material and delivery?
(Change to group sizes worked well today - thanks!)
I don't understand the emphasis on mindset. The carpentry workshops are for self-selceted group that wants to learn, so they are motivated and I don't think it matters if they believe they have talent for it or not, they all want to learn if I may, as en example I am motivated and want to learn statistics because I think that bad stats = pointless science, but I still think I'm inherently bad at maths, so I will need to overcome that perhaps if the teachers presents equations.(+1) for carpentry example: I want my research to be reproducible so I'm motivating in learning how to code / wrangle datasets but I think I'd be bad a programming complex stuff, or working from the command line. So I think the strategy to present concrete simple but very useful example at the start of the workshop can help with this 'fixed mindset'.
 Different participants in the breakout rooms made it difficult to build rapport. (Although in contrast, I liked the fact we moved around :) +1)
 Is there a preferred category of praise or are they all valid depending on context?
 Not a negative per se, but it would be good to have more time to practice presenting and getting feedback, though I appreciate this is difficult to do in this online setting+1+1+1+1 especially as we were then giving feedback on each other (but not really a negative as I understand that was the point of the exercise!)
The content was quite clear, but I had never thought about praise and mindset so much, so it will take some time to integrate it into how I present/teach. Very useful though
 Maybe have a different Etherpad per day? Makes it simpler to find the right location (or have shortcut links/table of contents - I think there is one in settings if that helps? Thanks! Didn't know about this)+1+1+1
 The bits on "praise" are a little abstract; however, I the surrounding conversation was excellent and instructive. I still contend that it okay to say "that is good work" to a student.
 Certain academics/events were mentioned, e.g. Guzdial and Ericson at Georgia Tech - it would be good to have the links/references/books for these. (Maybe they are in the lesson material?)+1
 I have heard in some situations the "praise/constructive criticism/praise" sandwich is more effective if you just do "praise/constructive criticism/action plan" as then the emphasis is on how to improve and not that you were without fault - would be interested to get your thoughts on this

PS - I like leaving feedback like this! (I like that we have/ can give feedback about feedback)
